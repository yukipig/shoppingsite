# shopping-site
I created a basic online shopping site to help promote my grandmother Veggies saling business.
My grandmother grows vegitables and sells them every summer in front of her house. 
However, because the only way to purchase was through direct, in-person sales, the number of customers was limited, and overall sales efficiency was low.

To solve this problem, I came up with the idea of launching an e-commerce site that would enable customers that are far away to buy the them online. 
This expansion will make it possible to increase both accessibility and overall sales revenue.
